# udacityMockUp
This is my first challenge in my Udacity Front End developer Nano Degree!

I have provided a mockup pdf to show the original challenge.

The goal wasn't to match all the images exactly but to get practice in building layouts. I had some fun by using fillmurray.com
for the placeholder images. This project uses my own custom 12 column grid and flexbox in tandem to build the multi columms.
